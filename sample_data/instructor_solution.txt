Instructor Solution: Solving Linear Equations

Problem: Solve for x: 2x + 5 = 13

Step 1: Subtract 5 from both sides
2x + 5 - 5 = 13 - 5
2x = 8

Step 2: Divide both sides by 2
2x / 2 = 8 / 2
x = 4

Step 3: Verify the solution
Substitute x = 4 back into the original equation:
2(4) + 5 = 13
8 + 5 = 13
13 = 13 âœ“

Therefore, x = 4 is the solution.

Method: Algebraic manipulation using inverse operations

Key Concepts:
- Inverse operations (subtraction undoes addition, division undoes multiplication)
- Maintaining equation balance (what you do to one side, do to the other)
- Verification by substitution
